# Google Maps Integration - Completed

## Overview

Successfully integrated Google Maps into the travel agent application to visualize travel locations from documents on an interactive map.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installed ✅

- `@react-google-maps/api` - Google Maps React wrapper
- `@types/google.maps` - TypeScript type definitions

### 2. Components Created ✅

#### `components/travel-map.tsx`

- Interactive Google Maps component
- Automatically plots all locations from travel documents
- Clickable markers with info windows
- Smart auto-centering and zoom based on locations
- Displays location details including dates

### 3. Maps Page Updated ✅

#### `app/(chat)/maps/page.tsx`

- Replaced placeholder with functional map
- Simplified implementation using mock data directly
- Empty state handling
- Ready for database integration
- API endpoint will be added when database is integrated

### 4. Documentation Added ✅

#### `docs/google-maps-setup.md`

- Complete setup guide for Google Maps API
- Environment variable configuration
- Troubleshooting section
- Security best practices

#### `README.md`

- Updated with Google Maps setup information
- Added link to detailed setup guide

## Features

1. **Interactive Map**: Users can pan, zoom, and explore their travel locations
2. **Markers**: Shows all locations from uploaded travel documents
3. **Info Windows**: Click markers to view location details
4. **Auto-centering**: Map automatically centers on user's locations
5. **Smart Zoom**: Adjusts zoom based on number and spread of locations

## How It Works

1. User navigates to the "Maps" page
2. System fetches all travel documents with coordinates
3. Locations are displayed as markers on the map
4. Clicking a marker shows info window with location details
5. Map automatically centers on all locations

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Database Integration**: Replace mock data with real database queries
2. **Custom Icons**: Add different marker icons for airports, hotels, stations, etc.
3. **Route Visualization**: Show connections between locations with polylines
4. **Location Clustering**: Group nearby markers for better performance with many locations
5. **Custom Styling**: Brand-specific map styling with custom colors
6. **Filters**: Filter by location type, date range, document, etc.
7. **Search**: Search for specific locations on the map
8. **Directions**: Get directions between locations

## Environment Setup

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

See `docs/google-maps-setup.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to `/maps` in your browser
3. You should see the Google Map with mock travel locations
4. Click on markers to view location details

## Notes

- Currently uses mock data from `lib/mock-data/travel-documents.ts`
- Ready for database integration when travel documents are fully implemented
- Requires Google Maps API key (see setup guide)
